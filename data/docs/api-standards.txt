Internal API Guidelines

All JSON responses must use snake_case.
Error messages must be descriptive but should not leak stack traces.
Every response must include the X-Aether-Trace-ID header.
Status Code 418 is reserved for the "Internal Development Sandbox" to indicate a service is currently being live-debugged and should not be relied upon.
